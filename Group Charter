1.  Availability for meeting expectations:
    We have decided we can meet on these days below:
    - Monday/Wednesday: 3:00pm to 3:20pm,  
    - Friday 2:00pm to 2:20pm.

2.  Response time to communication expectations
    - We hope to get a response from each other within 5 - 10 minutes, to assess and address
      any issues and concerns.

3.  Definition of done: when is a task complete? (hint: "I'm done with that but I didn't check it in to github" is not done.)
4.  Scrum meeting format/frequency and distribution of documentation tasks (meeting minutes, updating task board)
5.  Procedure for adopting policies (e.g. code style, code check-in steps, documentation updates)
    if you adopt such a policy during the initial meeting, put it here
6.  Procedure for handling a member who is not meeting expectations
    must include at least 3 actions before involving the instructor
7.  Signatures: each member must sign their name by typing their name at the bottom of the document.
